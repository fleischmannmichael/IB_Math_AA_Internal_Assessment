# IB Math AA HL IA: Image Classification as a Geometric Problem

This repository contains the mathematical implementation of an image classifier using Centroid-Based Classification in R3072.
Mathematical Concept

    Vectorization: Mapping 32×32 images to vectors in R3072.

    Centroids: Calculating μk​=n1​∑xi​ for each class (Pizza Slice, Whole Pizza, Pizza Box).

    Metrics: Comparing Euclidean (L2​), Manhattan (L1​), and Cosine Distance (1−cosθ).

Project Structure

    src/: Python scripts implementing the linear algebra logic.

    results/: Confusion matrices and generated mean images.

Results

    Cosine Accuracy: 80.00%

    Euclidean Accuracy: 73.33%
